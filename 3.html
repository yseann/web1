New media art refers to artworks created with new media technologies,
<br>including digital art, computer graphics, computer animation, virtual art, Internet art, interactive art, video games, computer robotics, 3D printing, cyborg art and art as biotechnology. The term differentiates itself by its resulting cultural objects and social events, which can be seen in opposition to those deriving from old visual arts (i.e. traditional painting, sculpture, etc.).

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_media_art" target="_blank" title="media">This concern with medium</a> is a key feature of much contemporary art
   and indeed many art schools and major universities now offer majors in
   "New Genres" or "New Media"[1] and a growing number of graduate programs
   have emerged internationally.[2] New media art often involves interaction
   between artist and observer or between observers and the artwork, which
   responds to them.</p>

 <p style="margin-top:40px;">Yet, as several theorists and curators have noted, such forms of interaction,
   social exchange, participation, and transformation do not distinguish
   new media art but rather serve as a common ground that has parallels
   in other strands of contemporary art practice.[3] Such insights emphasize
   the forms of cultural practice that arise concurrently with emerging technological
   platforms, and question the focus on technological media, per se.</p>
